### Machine Learning Internship at Afame Technology

During my internship at Afame Technology, I developed and optimized machine learning models for various predictive tasks. My responsibilities included data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. I worked extensively with Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and pandas, gaining hands-on experience in machine learning and data analysis. I collaborated with the team to improve model performance and deploy solutions into production. This internship provided me with valuable practical experience and enhanced my skills in building and deploying machine learning models.
